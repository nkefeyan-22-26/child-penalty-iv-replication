# Audit 02: Deconstructing Statistical Lies

## Overview
This audit exposes three common statistical deceptions used in tech and finance: **Latency Skew**, **False Positive Paradox**, and **Survivorship Bias**. Through simulation and calculation, I demonstrate how misleading metrics can distort reality.

## 1. Latency Skew: Why Standard Deviation Lies

**Scenario:** Network latency logs with 980 normal requests (20-50ms) and 20 spike outliers (1000-5000ms).

### Results:
- **Standard Deviation (SD):** 422.17
- **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD):** 8.00
- **SD/MAD Ratio:** 52.77x

### Finding:
The standard deviation **explodes** due to outliers because it uses **squared deviations** from the mean. A spike 3000ms away contributes 3000² = 9,000,000 to the calculation, while a normal deviation of 15ms contributes only 15² = 225—a 40,000x difference.

In contrast, MAD uses **absolute deviations** from the median and takes the median of those deviations. Outliers contribute linearly (3000 vs 15), and because MAD selects the median value, extreme outliers don't dominate the metric.

**Takeaway:** SD is hypersensitive to outliers. MAD provides a robust, stable measure of spread in skewed distributions.

## 2. False Positive Paradox: When 98% Accuracy Fails

**Scenario:** "IntegrityAI" plagiarism detector with 98% sensitivity and 98% specificity tested across three environments with different base rates of cheating.

### Results:
| Scenario | Base Rate | P(Cheater \| Flagged) |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **A: Bootcamp** | 50% | 98.00% |
| **B: Econ Class** | 5% | 72.06% |
| **C: Honors Seminar** | 0.1% | 4.68% |

### Finding:
Despite 98% accuracy, the system is **nearly useless** in the Honors Seminar context. When only 0.1% of students cheat, a flagged student has only a **4.68% chance** of actually being a cheater—a 95.32% false positive rate!

This occurs because the **base rate** (prior probability) dominates the posterior probability calculation via Bayes' Theorem. In low-prevalence environments, even highly accurate tests generate mostly false positives.

**Takeaway:** Accuracy metrics are meaningless without context. Always consider the base rate.

## 3. A/B Test Validity: Chi-Square Goodness of Fit

**Scenario:** "FinFlash" A/B test with 100,000 users (expected 50/50 split). Control received 50,250 users, Treatment received 49,750 users—500 fewer than expected.

### Results:
- **Observed:** [50,250, 49,750]
- **Expected:** [50,000, 50,000]
- **Chi-Square Statistic:** 2.50
- **Critical Value (p < 0.05):** 3.84

### Finding:
Chi-Square = 2.50 < 3.84, so the deviation is **not statistically significant** at the 0.05 level. The observed data does not have bias from random assignment. The "missing" 500 users in treatment can be attributed to random chance, not engineering problems or systematic bias.

**Takeaway:** Random assignment naturally produces variation. Statistical tests prevent us from seeing patterns in noise. The experiment is VALID.

## 4. Survivorship Bias: The Crypto Graveyard

**Scenario:** Simulated 10,000 token launches using a Pareto distribution (power law) where 99% fail near zero market cap.

### Results:
- **Total Tokens:** 10,000
- **Survivors (Top 1%):** 100
- **Mean Market Cap (All Tokens):** $174,084.21
- **Mean Market Cap (Survivors Only):** $4,363,352.12
- **Survivorship Bias Multiplier:** 25.06x

### Finding:
Looking only at successful tokens creates a **25x distortion** of reality. The typical crypto investor sees survivor stories worth $4.3M and assumes this represents the average outcome. The truth: the typical token is worth $174K—and 99% of launches fail to reach even modest valuations.

This is the **survivorship bias**—we only see the winners. The 9,900 tokens in the graveyard are invisible in media coverage, investment pitches, and success narratives.

**Takeaway:** Success stories hide mass failure. Always ask: "What am I not seeing?"

## Conclusion

Statistical deception thrives on three weaknesses:
1. **Using the wrong metric** (SD instead of MAD for skewed data)
2. **Ignoring base rates** (accuracy without prevalence context)
3. **Sampling only survivors** (seeing winners, missing losers)

These audits demonstrate that **numbers don't lie, but liars use numbers**. Question the metric, demand the context, and always look for what's hidden.
